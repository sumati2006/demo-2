                health is a multifaceted aspect of well-being encompassing emotional, psychological, and social well-being.

                realize one's potential,and contribute to society.Mental health conditions, which include mental disorders 
                and psychosocial disabilities, can significantly impact a person&apos;s ability to function and may 
                lead to distress or self-harm.</p>
